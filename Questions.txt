Amber Turing was hoping for Frothly (her beer company) to be acquired by a potential competitor which fell through, but visited their website to find contact information for their executive team. What is the website domain that she visited? Answer example: google.com 

Hints: Search for
index=botsv2 earliest=0 amber
and examine the client_ip field to find Amber's IP address.
Use a query like this to see her Web traffic, using her correct IP address:
index=botsv2 earliest=0 src_ip=1.1.1.1 
Restrict this query to the stream:http sourcetype. There are 198 events.
Look at the site values and look for names of rival beer makers.
