        "Question": "What is user btun's password on brewertalk.com?",
        "Hints": "His hashed password and salt was stolen via SQLi and captured in Splunk. Also note a 'top 1000' password list is available in a Splunk lookup table file called 'top_1000.csv'. Use '| inputlookup top_1000.csv' to inspect it.\n\nBy inspecting the code for this forum software, it can be determined that the stored password hash is computed as follows: md5( md5(salt) + md5(plaintext password) ) where '+' is simple string concatenation.\n\nThe Splunk eval command includes an md5 hash function. Beware that the exploit used in this attack chops the final character from the password hash and includes it as a single character string in the next SQLi extraction. When you use this string, either add the character back to the end of the hash, or just use a wildcard match on the beginning of it.\n\nBtun's salt value is 'tlX7cQPE' and his complete password hash is 'f91904c1dd2723d5911eeba409cc0d14'",

        "Question": "What is the average Shannon entropy score of the subdomain containing UDP-exfiltrated data? Answer guidance: Cut off, not rounded, to the first decimal place. Answer examples: 3.2 or 223234.9",
        "Hints": "First you will need to find the domain associated with the exfiltrated data. Look at the Stream metadata for a UDP protocol often used to exfiltrate data.\nReview the stream:dns sourcetype and find the IP address that has a high number of queries but is not a normal/legitimate target for DNS queries (IE not RFC1918 or Open DNS server). Look at the domain in the queries to that IP address. Pivot off of that to calculate shannon entropy.\n\nIf you have never calculated Shannon Entropy, look at the documents for the tool 'URL TOOLBOX' or recent entries in https://www.splunk.com/blog/2017/07/06/hunting-with-splunk-the-basics.html. This will teach you how to calculate Shannon entropy. Also review https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/events/govsummit/hunting_the_known_unknowns_with_DNS.pdf where you can learn how to detect DNS exfiltration",

Answer guidance: 4.4.4.4 has a different first octet than 8.4.4.4",
        "Hints": "Look through your notes of this incident, if you have any. Specifically look at the IP addresses used by Taedonggang. You will need to take information from the Taedonggang infrastructure seen attacking Frothy and pivot to open source intelligence. Specifically look at the C2\nIP address used by Taedonggang to control their PowerShell Empire agents. Remember that less is more! Sometimes the absence of data helps you find things.\n\nLook at the SSL certificates. Think about fields that you can pivot on in open source intelligence.\n\nTaking information from hint number 3. Pivot off of different fields in an open source intelligence website that catalogs SSL certificates until you find the server!
